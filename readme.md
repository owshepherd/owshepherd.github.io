## Description of your portfolio website ##
### Purpose ###
The purpose of my portfolio website is to generate interest among clients and/or potential employers, and showcase my previous work.

### Functionality and features ###
From the onset, my goal was to create a portfolio website that was visually interesting to visitors but was simplstic and lacked any needless stylistic additions. For example, while parallex images are great from a stylistic standpoint and help to create visual interest in a site, they add a lot of height to a page which forces visitors to scroll more than would otherwise be necessary. As such, while creating my portfolio website I have attempted to forgo needless flair and instead opted for a single page site, utilising page jumps to navigate between different sections.
The navigation bar found at the top of the page is hidden when the website is viewed below a certain width. Given that this is a single page site, I felt that implementing a hamburger menu or other hidden navigation option was unnecessary. Furthermore, I was reluctant to implement Javascript features to the site for worry that I would be jumping too far ahead of the lesson plan.
One issue I have about my site, however, is the alignment of badges used in the "Skills" section of the website. With the use of flexbox, this section can sometimes look a little messy depending on how the resolution is sized. A solution to this would be to use CSS to force a line break after a certain number of items appear in a row (which I have done). However, the code used (page-break and page-break-after) are currently only supported by Mozilla Firefox.
